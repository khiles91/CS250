    How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    To interpret user needs for implementation into the program, I need feedback on a program. The feedback provided by users gives the team an idea of what issues there are and if the users need something different out of the program. The user stories that are developed can help with this as it gives the team a main idea on what the user is looking for in the program. Some user stories at the start are not always full and leave a lot of questions to be answered. The team can ask these questions to the product owner and will gain more direct feedback on the needs to help develop the program as the user is wanting. 
    
    
    How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    When developing a program, I like to know the base requirements of what the user is looking for. After gaining the base requirements, I would write out a pseudocode to help gain an idea of how I want the code to function. After this I would begin by developing a few lines of code and testing them, just to make sure I catch errors early on. This type of planning can be used in my future development work as I can have a fleshed out idea of how I want the program structured and begin developing and testing the code. 
   
    
    What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    Communication is important to be a good team member in software development. When working with a team, it is helpful to talk with other team members and share ideas. Then these ideas can be discussed and if there are any issues. You have to be willing to take constructive criticism to aid in the development process. Some things may not work while others may work just fine, and having a team to bounce ideas off of and talk out all aspects is ideal as this broadens the views that are put into the program.
